## Visualisation module

### Drawing chart
Draw chart of accuracy or loss values for train an validation basis on *.npy files generated during Human Action Recognition NN training.

##### Parameters:
* **train-path** - absolute path to *.npy file with train results
* **test-path** - absolute path to *.npy file with test results
* **step** - step size

##### Example:
```
python draw_chart.py \
    --train-path '../results/lstm_simple_ep_10000_b_128_h_128_lr_1e-05_RMSPROP_train_acc.npy' \
    --test-path '../results/lstm_simple_ep_10000_b_128_h_128_lr_1e-05_RMSPROP_val_acc.npy' \
    --step 50
```

### Drawing pose
Script for drawing poses generated by MMPose or processed by VisualPose3D.

##### Parameters:
* **data-path** - path to data containing coordinates directory of "*.csv" files with poses for "many-poses", "*.csv" file with 2D single pose generated by MMPose with "hpe"module or "*.npy" file with 3D single pose generated bt VideoPose3D
* **ground-truth-video** - path to data with ground truth video
* **many-poses** - analyse many poses (only for 2D)
* **draw-3d** - draw in 3D

##### Example:
Draw many poses:
```
python draw_pose.py \
    --data-path ../pose_3d/unprocessed/ntu_rgbd/S001C001P001R001A001_rgb \
    --ground-truth-video ../../datasets/nturgb+d_rgb/cam1/S001C001P001R001A001_rgb.avi \
    --many-poses
```

Draw single pose (csv file with single pose, generated by "hpe" module using MMPose):
```
python draw_pose.py \
    --data-path ../pose_3d/unprocessed/ntu_rgbd/S001C001P001R001A001_rgb/S001C001P001R001A001_rgb_pose_0.csv \
    --ground-truth-video ../../datasets/nturgb+d_rgb/cam1/S001C001P001R001A001_rgb.avi
```

Draw single pose (input directory with poses, method will select pose with highest accuracy for each frame):
```
python draw_pose.py \
    --data-path ../pose_3d/unprocessed/ntu_rgbd/S001C001P001R001A001_rgb \
    --ground-truth-video ../../datasets/nturgb+d_rgb/cam1/S001C001P001R001A001_rgb.avi
```

Draw 3D (for single pose, using file generated by VideoPose3D by "pose_3d" module):
```
python draw_pose.py \
    --data-path ../datasets/nturgbd/3D/S001C001P001R001A001_rgb/3d_coordinates.npy \
    --draw-3d
```
